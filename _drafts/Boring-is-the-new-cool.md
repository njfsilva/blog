title: Boring is the new cool
---



Last Thursday, my good friend Ana Costa linked an article to me with the comment "Saw this and it reminded me of you".



The article was [Dan McKinley´s](https://twitter.com/mcfunley) [Choose boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology). A fascinating essay, you should go read it, right now. I´ll wait.



Let me make this clear to you, the reason she linked this article to me was not because I am particularly good at following the article´s main argument, that technology innovation does not mean following whatever trending technology is on twitter this week. 



Case and point, there was a particular time in my career where I had found a hammer, that hammer was so good, that I decided to make everything a nail. 

That hammer was MongoDb. 

There, I said it.



Let's get the "web scale" memes out of the way.

Ok, let's get back on point. As a software developer I like MongoDb, it's easy to use, easy to develop on, and assuming the project does not require relational features, it's my default flavor of NoSQL. 

But once upon a time, it was a hammer, **MY** hammer, and I spent months trying to turn everything into a nail.
