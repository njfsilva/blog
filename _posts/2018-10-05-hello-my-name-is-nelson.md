title: Hello, my name is Nelson

​	Over what probably constitutes the better part of the last 12 months, I have been contemplating starting a blog.

​	I have done it before, in fact I was fairly relevant blogger back in 2008 (shoutout to the boys still running [Planetgeek](http://planetgeek.org), after all these years), but back then, blogging was so new and exciting that the mere fact that you were doing it was enough to get you noticed.

​	I am not going to lie, I was mostly writing back then because it was exciting and new too, but most of what I wrote about was, looking back, fairly childish and provocateur. There were very little thought provoking arguments, and most of what I did was complain about whatever popular technologies were hip back then (I was going through a Linux/hate on Apple phase). In retrospect, I'm guessing this was fairly common for an 18-19 year old teenager who was into technology and liked rambling on the internet. 

​	These days, after getting through college and getting a Master's degree, moving in together with my partner in crime, getting married, having a small boy  and working in the tech industry for 8 years, with various of these events overlapping at any given point in time, I like to fancy myself someone a bit wiser (although still ill tempered) than my former self, and I believe there might be enough experiences and opinions worth sharing with the internet.

​	That is, for the most part, what I will be doing here. You will find that most of what I will write about is not so much about the technical side of being a software developer, although I'm sure it will be a fairly frequent event around here (its pretty much inevitable, it is my job, and what I love to do after all), but I will be writing mostly about the industry itself, and my thoughts on it.

​	So, without further ado:
